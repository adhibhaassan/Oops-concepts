# Oops-concepts
# Object Oriented Programming
It is a programming approach that organizes code into objects and classes and makes it more structured, easy to manage and more secure. The core idea of OOPs is to bind data and the functions together and operate on it.

# Class
It is an user-defined blueprint for creating objects which combines the variables and functions together into a single unit.

# Objects
It is an instance of a class which contains the specific data and functions defined in a class.One class can have many objects.

# Inheritance
It is a process by which we can reuse the functionalities of existing classes to new classes. In the concept of inheritance, there are two terms base (parent) class and derived (child) class. When a class is inherited from another class (base class), it (derived class) obtains all the data and functions of the base class.

# Abstraction
It is a technique of hiding confidential or complex internal details and showing only the necessary functionalities.It helps in reducing the complexity and improving maintainability.

# Polymorphism
It stands for many forms. It means different objects can respond to the same command (or "method call") in their own unique way. It makes your code super flexible because you can write general instructions that work for a variety of specific things, instead of having to write separate instructions for each one.It helps in better reusability.

# Encapsulation
It is bundling up data (like the watch's internal mechanisms) and the actions that operate on that data (like setting the time) into one neat package (the watch itself). It hides the complex internal workings from the outside world and only allows controlled access through specific, safe ways (like turning the crown). This protects the data and makes the code easier to manage and fix.
